# Speech-to-Text-with-Deepgram-API

This project is a real-time Voice-to-Text transcription tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with optional Deepgram API integration. Designed with simplicity and user control in mind, the tool allows users to start and stop voice recording through intuitive buttons. As the user speaks, their speech is transcribed live and displayed in a text area on the screen. The interface is minimal yet visually appealing, featuring a calming gradient background and modern rounded UI elements for a smooth user experience.
For real-time transcription, I utilized the Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) for seamless browser-based speech recognition. This eliminates the need for backend infrastructure, making the tool lightweight and easy to deploy. The transcription is displayed instantly, ensuring users get immediate feedback as they speak. Once the user stops recording, the final transcribed text remains visible.
The tool handles microphone permissions, continuous listening, and edge cases such as speech pauses, making it both reliable and practical. This project demonstrates how a simple voice interface can be implemented using web technologies and API services, and itâ€™s a step toward accessible voice-controlled applications. It can be extended further with backend services like Deepgram for enhanced accuracy and custom speech models.
